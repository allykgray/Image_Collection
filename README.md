Collection of Imagenet Images - Python Programs for Filtering

This simple script will arrange image catergories and prep them for neural network training with Caffe, but may work with others. I often rearrange my images in to different categories before training, this script allows me to easily do this without changing the originals with their original names (e.g. n02349992).
